# Autoencoders Tutorials
All about Autoencoder one needs to know to get started with them and the generative models. It's a step by step tutorial meant for beginners.
# SetUp Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Download Jupyter notebook either from conda package or "pip install jupyter notebook"
3. Run jupyter notebook in the console
4. You are all set to run the programs

I encourage everybody to follow the instructions in the manner i have set up for a better understanding of the topic especially for beginners. And for all those running the program, you may try to run them on the cloud. I personally like doing it on Google Colab. So check it out.
# Tutorial Instructions
Follow the notebook in following manner - 
1. Shallow Autoencoder
2. Sparse Autoencoder
3. Deep Autoencoder
4. Deep Convolutional Autoencoder
5. Denoising Autoencoder
6. Image Colorization with Autoencoders Three Versions
7. Anamoly detection with autoencoder

I will keep on adding new and new matter to it. So keep an eye on it for more...
